### üßê About Me

I am a motivated and ambitious Python Developer with 2 years of experience, constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and take on new challenges. My expertise lies in programming in Python, Django framework, machine learning, and data visualization. I am passionate about developing innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.

ü§ù I value good communication and teamwork, and I am comfortable admitting my mistakes and learning from them.

üë®‚Äçüíª At U+Geo sp. z o.o., I created an agent-based mobility model to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in urban areas, which achieved an MAE of 0.224 in predicting SARS-CoV-2 cases. I also developed a machine learning classification model to predict the risk of avian influenza in Poland, which achieved a sensitivity of around 68%.

üë®‚Äçüíº I designed and implemented the Flualert web service, which is based on the Django framework and presents the results of the avian influenza prediction model to clients. Additionally, I was responsible for both the front-end and back-end of the platform, and I implemented online payment functionality using the Stripe API. I worked using the Agile Scrum methodology.
